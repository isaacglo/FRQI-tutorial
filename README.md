# FRQI-tutorial
This notebook is a small tutorial for the implementation of the Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI) [1]. The main objective of this work is to people understand how the quantum circuit of this quantum image representation may look like, see how we can encode classical images into quantum images, and how the retrieve of such images works.
